MyISAM supports the following features: 

Storage formats: MyISAM supports three storage formats: fixed, dynamic, and compressed. The first two are chosen automatically based on the type of columns used. The compressed format can only be created with the myisampack utility.
    VARCHAR type: MyISAM supports a true VARCHAR type.
    Foreign keys: MyISAM does not support foreign key constraints.
    Indexing: MyISAM supports indexes for efficient data retrieval.
    Table-level locking: MyISAM uses table-level locking for concurrent access control.

MyISAM also has the following limitations: 
    Reliable recovery: MyISAM does not support reliable recovery for user-created schemas.
    Data corruption: MyISAM can result in lost or corrupt data when MySQL is restarted after a recovery.
    Point-in-time restore: MyISAM prevents Point-In-Time restore or snapshot restore from working as intended.
