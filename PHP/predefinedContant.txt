__FILE__	The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned.

__FUNCTION__	The function name, or {closure} for anonymous functions.
__CLASS__	The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar). When used in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait is used in.
__TRAIT__	The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. Foo\Bar).
__METHOD__	The class method name.
__NAMESPACE__	The name of the current namespace.


CLSCTX_ALL (int)	23	Indicates all class contexts. This definition ORs CLSCTX_INPROC_HANDLER and CLSCTX_SERVER.	 
VT_NULL (int)	1	NULL pointer reference.	 
VT_EMPTY (int)	0	A property with a type indicator of VT_EMPTY has no data associated with it; that is, the size of the value is zero.	 
VT_INT (int)
