PHP 5 introduced several significant features and improvements over its predecessor, PHP 4. Some of the key features of PHP 5 include:

1. **Improved Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support**: PHP 5 greatly enhanced its support for OOP, introducing features like visibility (public, protected, and private), interfaces, abstract classes, and constructors/destructors.

2. **Exceptions Handling**: PHP 5 introduced a modern exception handling mechanism, allowing developers to throw and catch exceptions, which greatly improved error handling in applications.

3. **Improved MySQL Extension**: PHP 5 included an improved MySQL extension called MySQLi (MySQL Improved), which provided a more secure and feature-rich interface for interacting with MySQL databases.

4. **PDO Extension**: PHP 5 introduced the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension, which provides a consistent interface for accessing various databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc., using a unified API.

5. **SPL (Standard PHP Library)**: PHP 5 introduced the SPL, which is a collection of interfaces and classes that provide common data structures and algorithms, such as arrays, iterators, and iterators for files.

6. **Improved XML Support**: PHP 5 improved its XML support with features like SimpleXML and XMLReader/XMLWriter extensions, making it easier to parse and manipulate XML documents.

7. **Improved Performance**: PHP 5 showed significant performance improvements over PHP 4, especially in terms of memory usage and execution speed.

8. **Zend Engine 2**: PHP 5 utilized the Zend Engine 2, which provided a more powerful execution environment for PHP scripts, including better performance and memory management.

These are some of the notable features introduced in PHP 5, which played a crucial role in modernizing the language and making it more powerful and versatile for building web applications.
