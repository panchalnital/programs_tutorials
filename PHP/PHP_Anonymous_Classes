In PHP, anonymous classes are a way to create a class without defining it first. They are useful for creating one-off classes or classes that are only needed for a short period of time. 

Here are some features of anonymous classes:
    Anonymous classes are useful when simple, one-off objects need to be created.
    Anonymous classes are not associated with a name.
    Anonymous classes are created using the new keyword and a closure.
    Anonymous classes can accept arguments through the constructor.
    Anonymous classes can be extended from others classes, can use interfaces etc.. 

To create an anonymous class, you can use the class keyword combined with the new keywords:
    Use the new keyword
    Use the class keyword without the name
    Open close curly braces with a semicolon
    Put your regular class structure inside this curly braces

PHP Anonymous Classes allow you to create classes on the fly without explicitly defining their names. They are useful for situations where you need a simple, one-off class that doesn't need to be reused elsewhere in your code.

Here's a basic example of how you can use anonymous classes in PHP:

```php
<?php

// Define an interface
interface Logger {
    public function log($message);
}

// Create an anonymous class that implements the Logger interface
$logger = new class implements Logger {
    public function log($message) {
        echo $message;
    }
};

// Use the anonymous class
$logger->log("Hello, world!");
```

In this example, we define an interface called `Logger` with a single method `log()`. Then, we create an anonymous class that implements this interface. We can then instantiate the anonymous class and use it just like any other class.

Anonymous classes are particularly handy for situations where you need to pass a class as an argument to a method or function, but you don't want to define a separate named class for it. They're also useful for quickly prototyping or testing code.

Keep in mind that anonymous classes are only available in PHP 7 and later versions.
