Definition
define() is a function for defining global constants with runtime evaluation and dynamic nature. 
const is a language construct for defining class constants with compile-time evaluation and a static value that cannot be modified

Case sensitivity
const is always case-sensitive, but define() has a case-insensitive option.

Block scope
const cannot be created inside another block scope, like inside a function or inside an if statement. define() can be created inside another block scope.
