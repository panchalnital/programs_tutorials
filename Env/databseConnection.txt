When dealing with databases and multiple connections, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:

=> Connection Pooling: Connection pooling is a technique used to efficiently manage and reuse database connections. Instead of opening and closing a new connection every time a request is made, a pool of connections is maintained. This reduces the overhead of creating and tearing down connections, improving performance.

=> Concurrency Control: When multiple connections are accessing the same database simultaneously, you need to implement concurrency control mechanisms to prevent data corruption or inconsistencies. Common techniques include locks, transactions, and isolation levels.

=> Connection Limits: Most database management systems (DBMS) have limits on the number of concurrent connections they can handle. Be aware of these limits and ensure that your application doesn't exceed them, as it can lead to performance issues.

=> Connection Strings: When connecting to a database, you typically use a connection string that contains information about the database server, authentication credentials, and other settings. Ensure that you securely manage and store these connection strings to prevent unauthorized access.

=> Load Balancing: In scenarios with high traffic or distributed systems, you might use load balancing to distribute database connections evenly across multiple database servers. This helps improve scalability and fault tolerance.

=> Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging to keep track of database connections, their usage, and any errors or performance issues. Tools like database connection pools often provide metrics for monitoring.

=> Connection Timeouts: Set appropriate connection timeouts to avoid resource leaks in case a connection cannot be established or gets stuck. This prevents your application from holding onto connections indefinitely.

=> Database Connection Security: Always follow security best practices, such as using strong authentication, encrypting connections (e.g., using SSL/TLS), and restricting database access to authorized users only.

=> Connection Leak Detection: Implement mechanisms to detect and handle connection leaks, where a connection is not properly closed after use. Leaked connections can lead to resource exhaustion.

=> Database Scaling: As your application grows, you might need to scale your database infrastructure. Consider options like sharding, replication, or moving to a more scalable database system to handle increased connection demands.

How to scale a web application to a million users in 10 steps

1- Vertically scale your server which means use a faster computer.
2- Put your database to another server, this will relieve your application server.
3- Add a load balancer and more back end servers (or basically horizontally scale)
4- Don’t forget to add a firewall which will protect you from various attacks
5- Move expensive calculations to front end like rendering web pages. Use a content deliver network
6-Add read only replicas for expensive queries or analytics
7-Cache expensive calculations or db queries
8-Divide monolith to micro services so that you don’t have to deploy every line of code to every machine and you can scale one part of your application independent from others
9-Where necessary use a queue system to communicate between micro services
10-Start using non relational databases like Cassandra or elastic search depending on business.

======================
 I cover load balancing, content delivery networks, mysql query optimization, database master/slave replication, horizontal/vertical sharding, and more.

* Note, these experiences were from projects before I began working at Google, so I'm talking about my individual experiences (Google uses a ton more techniques, though the basic concepts are similar).  I'm sure I missed some things, so please share in the comments below if you have thoughts on how to scale!  I'd love to hear.
