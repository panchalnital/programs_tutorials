============================================================

The scp command is a secure copy protocol that allows users to securely copy files and directories between two locations, usually between Unix or Linux systems. It is a command line utility that uses SSH to transfer data, so it requires a password or passphrase for authentication. Unlike rcp or FTP, scp encrypts both the file and any passwords exchanged so that anyone snooping on the network cannot view them.
To use the scp command, you will need to know the following information:
    =>The username and password for the source and target systems
    =>The path to the file or directory you want to copy
    =>The IP address or hostname of the source and target systems

Once you have this information, you can use the following syntax to copy a file from one server to another:

scp username@source_host:source_file destination_host:destination_directory

scp -r user@destination_host:/backup/ /local_backup/

==================================================

Search for a specific text in files:
    grep "search_term" /path/to/directory

Search recursively in subdirectories:
    grep -r "search_term" /path/to/directory

Case-insensitive search:
    grep -i "search_term" /path/to/directory

Display line numbers along with matching lines:
    grep -n "search_term" /path/to/directory

=========================================================
List Running Processes:
    ps aux
    This command displays a list of all running processes on the server.

    uname -a
    This command shows detailed information about the system, such as the kernel version, architecture, and hostname.

List Open Ports:
    netstat -tuln
    This command lists all the open ports and associated services on the server.

View System Logs:
    tail /var/log/syslog
    Check system logs for any recent events or issues.

Check Disk Usage:
    df -h
    This command provides information about disk space usage on the server.

Check Memory Usage:
    free -m
    Display information about free and used memory on the server.

apt-get :
    is a command line tool for handling Advanced Package Tool (APT) libraries in Debian-based Linux, like Ubuntu. It requires sudo or root privileges.

    This Linux command lets you manage, update, remove, and install software, including its dependencies. Here’s the main syntax:

    apt-get [options] (command)
    These are the most common commands to use with apt-get:

    update – synchronizes the package files from their sources.
    upgrade – installs the latest version of all installed packages.
    check – updates the package cache and checks broken dependencies
SSH :
To connect to a remote server with the username "user" and the hostname or IP address "192.168.1.1", 
    ssh user@192.168.1.1
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@192.168.1.1
    ssh user@192.168.1.1 -p 2222
