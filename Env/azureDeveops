Sure, here's a step-by-step tutorial for beginners on using Azure DevOps:

1. **Introduction to Azure DevOps:**
   - Understand the basic concepts of Azure DevOps, which is a set of development tools for planning, collaborating on code development, and deploying applications.

2. **Creating an Azure DevOps Account:**
   - Sign up for an Azure DevOps account if you don't already have one. You can use your existing Microsoft account or create a new one.

3. **Creating Projects:**
   - Once logged in, create a new project in Azure DevOps. Give your project a name, description, and choose appropriate settings like version control options.

4. **Setting up Repositories:**
   - Decide on your version control system (Git or Team Foundation Version Control). Create a repository to store your project's source code.

5. **Working with Boards:**
   - Use Azure Boards for planning and tracking work items such as user stories, tasks, bugs, etc. Learn how to create and manage work items on your board.

6. **Setting up Pipelines:**
   - Azure Pipelines allow you to automate builds, tests, and deployments. Create a pipeline to define the steps for building and deploying your application.

7. **Creating Builds:**
   - Configure your pipeline to build your application from the source code stored in your repository. Define the build tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, and generating artifacts.

8. **Running Tests:**
   - Integrate testing into your pipeline by adding tasks to run unit tests, integration tests, or any other automated tests you have for your application.

9. **Setting up Deployment:**
   - Define the deployment tasks in your pipeline to deploy your application to various environments like development, staging, and production.

10. **Monitoring and Continuous Improvement:**
    - Use Azure Monitor and Application Insights to monitor the performance and usage of your application. Analyze the data to identify areas for improvement and iterate on your development process.

11. **Collaboration and Integration:**
    - Explore features for collaborating with team members, such as code reviews, pull requests, and integration with other tools like Visual Studio, JIRA, Slack, etc.

12. **Learning Resources:**
    - Take advantage of online resources, tutorials, documentation, and community forums to deepen your understanding of Azure DevOps and stay updated with best practices.

Remember, Azure DevOps is a powerful platform with many features, so don't hesitate to explore and experiment with different functionalities to find what works best for your team and project.

What id DevOPS:
DevOps word menas word which is fromed from the coobimation of two world example smog
(Development(developer)+operations)

developer                       Operation
             ________
        Plan     ___|______________UAT
Excution       __|  |                   Live
        Test __|    |______________Assistence



=> The dev and operation sholud work like Unit

=>Philosophy
    (Dev & OPs Team work together)
=>Process
    (Palnning,Excution & Testing)
=>Tools
    (Like azure & AWS DevOps for Automattion)

Mapping Boards,Repos,pipelines,testPlan & Artifats with DevOps life sycle

1) Planing (Boards)
        WorkItems
        Board
        backlogs
        sprints
        queries
        deleievry plan 
        analysic View
2)Excution (Ropos) (write code,check the code,build the code)
        file
        commit
        push
        branches
        tag
        pull request
        advance security
3)Testing (Test Plans) (manulay testing,internal testing,re)
        test plans
        progress report
        run
4)pipelines         (apk,exc,javascript file)
        Pipelines
        Envirom=nmnets
        releases
        library
        task group
        Deployment groups
5)Artifacts (UAT)

================================
1) Planing (Boards)

Setp 1 the planning phase:
        unserstanding boards and work items:
        1.1 WorkItems:
                New work items:
                    1)Epic
                    2)issue
                    3)taks
step 2 exution check simple mvc projects code ,cloning,commit, synch in aure repos

    commit ->push code on branche
    ->build->publish

step 3 defining and understanding Agents in azure Devops

    => Agent :Agent is a software which run inside machine annd executes the pipeline task

    -> go setting -> agent pools -> Azure pipelines->agents
            -> hosted agent

    =>Now create the pipeline
        ->azure reporti git 
        ->gitlab
        ->git 

       ->azure reporti git -> select projects repoet
        after select YAML file save

        type agent
        ->hosted agent (mircsoft)
        ->self agent(local machine)
        ->azure virtal machine (mircsoft)


        PS C:\agent> .\config.cmd

        PS C:\agent> .\run.cmd
