============================================================

The scp command is a secure copy protocol that allows users to securely copy files and directories between two locations, usually between Unix or Linux systems. It is a command line utility that uses SSH to transfer data, so it requires a password or passphrase for authentication. Unlike rcp or FTP, scp encrypts both the file and any passwords exchanged so that anyone snooping on the network cannot view them.
To use the scp command, you will need to know the following information:
    =>The username and password for the source and target systems
    =>The path to the file or directory you want to copy
    =>The IP address or hostname of the source and target systems

Once you have this information, you can use the following syntax to copy a file from one server to another:

scp username@source_host:source_file destination_host:destination_directory

scp -r user@destination_host:/backup/ /local_backup/

==================================================

Search for a specific text in files:
    grep "search_term" /path/to/directory

Search recursively in subdirectories:
    grep -r "search_term" /path/to/directory

Case-insensitive search:
    grep -i "search_term" /path/to/directory

Display line numbers along with matching lines:
    grep -n "search_term" /path/to/directory
