A robots.txt file is a set of instructions for bots that tells search engine crawlers which URLs they can access on a website. It's used to avoid overloading a site with requests. 

A robots.txt file is included in the source files of most websites. It consists of one or more rules. Each rule blocks or allows access for all or a specific crawler to a specified file path on the domain or subdomain where the robots.txt file is hosted. 

A robots.txt file helps website owners control the behavior of search engine crawlers. It allows them to: 

Manage access
Limit indexing to specific areas
Regulate crawling rate

A robots.txt file is not a mechanism for keeping a web page out of Google. To keep a web page out of Google, you 

can: 
Block indexing with noindex
Password-protect the page
Google stopped supporting the unofficial robots.txt noindex directive in September 2019.











===============================
.htaccess
Tells your Apache server how to handle page and file names, URLs, and a user's way to access these resources. It's used for directory-level access control, URL redirection, and URL rewriting.

robots.txt
Instructs search engine crawlers which pages on a website they can and cannot crawl. It's included in the source files of most websites.

.htaccess is used mostly for internal access, while robots.txt manages external access. The server software always obeys the .htaccess file, but a search engine may or may not obey the instructions written in the robots.txt file. 

To create a robots.txt file, you can: 

Create a file named robots.txt.
Add rules to the robots.txt file.
Upload the robots.txt file to the root of your site.
Test the robots.txt file.
