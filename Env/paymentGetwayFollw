$keyId = 'rzp_test_cjE4BZ0g5hZd9q';
$keySecret = 'ccAoLjOBdirrRdFnzQdoIQTW';
$displayCurrency = 'INR';

step 1: 

$api = new Api($keyId, $keySecret);
$orderData = [
    'receipt'         => 3456,
    'amount'          => $req_data['amount'] * 100,
    'currency'        => $req_data['currency'],
    'payment_capture' => 1
];
$razorpayOrder = $api->order->create($orderData);
$razorpayOrderId = $razorpayOrder['id']; // gernate order id 
$_SESSION['razorpay_order_id'] = $razorpayOrderId;

    ------------------------------------------

    To verify the razorpay_signature returned to you by the Checkout form:

=>Create a signature in your server using the following attributes:
    
    order_id: Retrieve the order_id from your server. Do not use the razorpay_order_id returned by Checkout.
    razorpay_payment_id: Returned by Checkout.
    key_secret: Available in your server. The key_secret that was generated from the Razorpay Dashboard.
    Use the SHA256 algorithm, the razorpay_payment_id and the order_id to construct a HMAC hex digest as shown below:
    
    HMAC Hex Digest
    
    copy
    
=> generated_signature = hmac_sha256(order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id, secret);
    
      if (generated_signature == razorpay_signature) {
        payment is successful
      }
    If the signature you generate on your server matches the razorpay_signature returned to you by the Checkout form, the payment received is from an authentic source.
    
    Generate Signature on Your Server
    
=>Given below is the sample code for payment signature verification:
    
   
    $api = new Api($key_id, $secret);
    
    $api->utility->verifyPaymentSignature(array('razorpay_order_id' => $razorpayOrderId, 'razorpay_payment_id' => $razorpayPaymentId, 'razorpay_signature' => $razorpaySignature));
    Post Signature Verification
    After you have completed the integration, you can set up webhooks, make test payments, replace the test key with the live key and integrate with other APIs.
