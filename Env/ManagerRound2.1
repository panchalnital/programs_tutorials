1 => Tell me something about yourself?
    : self name,location,total expresines

2 => About ypu current projects?

      Q) Explain your Projects Architecture?

      - Its 4 Layer architecture with font end in react JS, Middel Layer in MVC,Data
        access Layer uses EFand DB in SQL Server.
      - Laravel fremwork follow MVC Architecture where model has bussiness logic,view look and feel and controller connect the model and the view.
      - In Projects we have implmenetd best practices and desiggn pattens like respository/factory,sigleton,iterator pattern and so on

      Architecture style(definess the guidelines and priciple)      : rest api
      architecure pattens(defines the blocak level)                 : MVC,
      designe pattern(has a very specific context and also demonstrates code): sigleton,factory,fascad,

      Architecture style : represents a set of principles or guidelines that shape the overall structure and organization of a sofware system eg. REst,SOA

      architecure pattens : provide general structures/layers for desiging software system eg. mVA,Layerweed architecture,MVVM and so on

      designe pattern is soluation for ecurring problem in software desn and it has a very clear context eg.actory pattern,iterator pattern

    :high level user of projects,domain name like (shoping (B2B,B2C))
                                ,Health, finance,data analysic, music indicater, 
     stack for user backend : PHP ,PHP freawork Laravel,Rest API , SQL,Redis, deployment tools using AzureDevOps 
     model using fllow Agile 
     e.g i current working jiomart applicatin for shoping on online website or api using in facility retailer buying in thought application and also another ooption b2c customer buying on online website and application products and items and
     technoliy using  backend : PHP ,PHP freawork Laravel,Rest API , SQL,Redis, deployment tools using AzureDevOps 

3 => Roles and Responsibilities in projects?
    (Estimation,desing,developments,Unit testcases,Deployment,Bug Fixing)
    PHP developers my role is a,
     => estimate story and requriments 
     => and then create designe 
     => and developments 
     => and unit testing  
     => finaliy changes deployment on Difference Environment(branches)
     => and also supporting live or productions environment BUGs fixes and on environment

    and one achivements on 3 months timeline margarate on PHP 5.6 to 8 and Yi too yii exiting functionality


4 => Technical design of projects ?
    => i working web api and app api based on MVC architecture and 
    => domian driven 
    => php dependent on dependency injection  serivces 
    => doctrim freawork working database
    => JWT Token and API key token based on authorination authorized
    => AzureDevOps using for unit test prapose and deployment
    => we fllow the solid prinicple for using de-coupledesing

6 => working on weekends in delivey time
    => suppose it is the delivery time.
    => and therfore,you have work on weekends.
    => if you need that time will be available on time 
   Q => 
    1 => at last moment of projects delievry the requriments is changed
    2 => somebody resigned from the team and there is extra workload n you 
    3 => you are asked to learn a new technoloy for a new projects
    4 => you are introduced in a project with tigh dealine 


============================================================================

**Software architecture styles are a set of patterns and principles that guide how a software system is organized. They determine how modules and components within the system communicate and interact. Architectural styles can provide quality, scalability, reusability, consistency, and clarity. When choosing an architecture for a project, you can consider things like performance, scalability, maintainability, security, and complexity**

**Here are some examples of software architecture styles:**
**Rest**
**SOA**
**Microservices**
An application is built as a collection of small, independent services that work together to perform tasks.

**Monolithic**
A single block of all features a software provides in a single codebase. Everything is tightly coupled and dependent on one another, but the software as a whole is independent of any third-party services.

**Layered**
Also known as n-tier architectural style, this style is divided into various horizontal layers and each layer has some specific function.

**Serverless**
A type of Web application architecture that provides a way for programmers to build an application faster by removing them to manage the infrastructure needed to run the code

**Other examples of software architecture patterns include:**
Message bus
Service requester/consumer
MVC pattern
MVVM
Microkernel
Domain-driven design components
Presentation-abstraction-control



**Factory Pattern**
means factory pattern to do decouploing we want to centtralize the objects creetaer wht are you 

**Repository pattern**
that we can have an abstraction over the data source therer is a  specific context when it comes to designe pattern archiecture style let us try
===========================================================================================
Architecture style
  - Layered architecture pattern
      presentation layer
      Business layer
      persisyence layer
      database layer
  - Event-driven                      --> event consumer
      event producer-->event Ingestion--> event consumer
                                      --> event consumer
  - Monolithic
  - Microservices
  - Microkernel
  - Server
  - Service-oriented architecture
  - Hybrid architecture
