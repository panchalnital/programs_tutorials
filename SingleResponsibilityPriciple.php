The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. 
They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure


They all serve the same purpose:

"To create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on."


s=> Single Responsibility Priciple

"a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change"
"A class should have one and only one reason to change,
 meaning that a class should have only one job"

Sure, I can help you with that! In PHP, the Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. To make a Singleton class thread-safe, you can use various techniques. One commonly used method is to use the double-checked locking pattern. Here's an example of a thread-safe Singleton in PHP:

Copy
class Singleton {
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static function getInstance() {
        if (self::$instance === null) {
            // Use double-checked locking to ensure thread safety
            synchronized (self::class) {
                if (self::$instance === null) {
                    self::$instance = new self();
                }
            }
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }

    public function someBusinessLogic() {
        // Add your methods and logic here
    }
}

// Example usage:
$singleton = Singleton::getInstance();
$singleton->someBusinessLogic();
In this example:

The constructor is made private to prevent direct instantiation.
getInstance() is the method to obtain the Singleton instance.
The double-checked locking pattern is used to ensure thread safety. It checks if the instance is null and, if so, creates a new instance within a synchronized block.
The someBusinessLogic() method represents the business logic of your Singleton class.
