queues can be used to defer the processing of time-consuming tasks, like sending emails, until a later time. This can help speed up web requests to your application. Queues can also be used for email notifications and to stop other connections if used in a sync process. 


To set up queues in a Laravel project, you can follow these steps:
Update the .env file
Import the ShouldQueue class in your Notification class
Implement the ShouldQueue interface in your Notification class
Generate the database tables to store the queued data
Migrate the tables
Run the queue

    class InvoicePaid extends Notification implements ShouldQueue
