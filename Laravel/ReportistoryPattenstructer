repository pattern laravel

The repository design pattern is a software design pattern that separates the data access layer and business logic layer of an application. It provides a consistent interface to access data stored in a database, file system, or external service. 

The repository pattern: 

-Abstracts the data layer of an application
-Provides a separation of concerns between the application's data access layer and business logic layer
-Allows you to use objects without having to know how these objects are persisted
-Creates a bridge between models and controllers
-Provides a collection interface to access data
-Allows you to inject the repository into your controllers or services and use its methods to interact with the data layer

-The repository pattern consists of adding a layer of classes that are in charge of accessing the data source and obtaining the different data models. These classes have methods such as: find, findAll, create, update. 

To use the repository pattern in a Laravel application, you need: 
A basic understanding of PHP and Laravel
-PHP 7.4
-Composer installed globally
-cURL
-Git
-jq (optional)
-The Laravel installer
-Access to a MySQL database
