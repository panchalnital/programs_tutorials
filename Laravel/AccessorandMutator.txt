Mutators : 
- mutators is setter method in model class setUserNameAttribute()
- mutator transforms an eloquent attributes value when it set
-Used to format attributes before saving them into the database. For example, you may want to hash passwords before storing them.

in model file 
public function setUserNameAttribute($value){
    $this->attributes['user_name']=ucword($value);
}

public function getDodAttribute($value){
    return date('d-M-y',strtotime($value));
}
