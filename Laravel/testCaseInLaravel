Why you should write Test case ?

1)* if any bug getting and fixed code they not impact other code and modules that reson to write the test code 

    1 spot ambiguities early 
    2 write better code in the frist place
    3 easir debugging
    4 refactor with confidenece
    5 release with confidenece
    6 better desin

2) Two type of test code in laravel
    i) Fature : feature test means the if you test route (particaulr functionality or modelular) is call feature test
    - if test login and register functionality is call feture test
    A feature test should hit a route ,make sure  the resposne if what you want and the databse reflects the changes you made( if there are )

    II) unit test:  if test particauler function or method is called unit test() 

    a unit test should test a single pieact of functionality they are made to ensure a particauler method(or unit ) of a class performs a set of speficfic task

    Run the test 
    i) php artisan test
       php artisan test --filter=test_the_application_returns_a_successful_response
    
    II) ./vendor/bin/phpunit
        ./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter=test_the_application_returns_a_successful_response

    deault the feature test file create 
    php artisan make:test LoginTest

    php artisan make:test LoginTest --unit
