    -> Laravel's command scheduler allows users to schedule commands and tasks to run on specific days and times
    -> Users can schedule tasks to run every minute, every hour, every day, or every week. They can also schedule tasks to run at specific times or on a recurring schedule based on the day of the week


    The Laravel scheduler is configured using the 
    App\Console\Kernel


    Here's a basic example of scheduling a task in Laravel:

        Copy
        protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
        {
            $schedule->command('emails:send')->daily();
        }
        In this example, the emails:send command will be executed daily according to the schedule defined.

    1)
         php artisan make:command everyMinute

        app\console\commands  one files create on 
        everyMinute.php
                                command_name
        protected $signature = 'minute:update';

        handle(){
            pass the any operation in performac here
            //DB::table('emps')->delete();
        }

    2) app\console\kernal.php add command

         protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
        {
            // $schedule->command('inspire')->hourly();
            $schedule->commands('minute:update')->everyMinute();
        }

    option 3) php artisan minute:update

    4) php artisan schedule:run
crontab -e
* * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

 5) crontab set the command

    /usr/local/bin/php/home1/hospital/public_html/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
