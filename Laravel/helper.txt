app/helper.php

To create a custom helper in Laravel, you can do the following: 
    Create a helper file
    Define the helper functions
    Include the helper file
    Run Composer Update
Utilize the custom helper functions

You can also: 
    Include the helper file in your composer.json
    Add the libraries folder to the composer.json file
    Run composer dump
    Register all helper files for the application in the register method of the service provider
    Use the glob() php helper to specify the pathnames for the helper files
    Match all files with a .php extension as a helper file

You can put helper classes anywhere you want. For example, you can put them in app/helpers.php and then require that file in app/start/global.php. You can also add them in app/helpers (new folder) and then autoload that folder with composer.


Creating a custom helper in Laravel is a common task, and it can be really useful for encapsulating commonly used functions or methods. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a custom helper in Laravel:

Create a Helper File:


===========================
In your Laravel project, you can create a new helper file or use an existing one. Commonly, these files are placed in the app directory. You can create a new one if needed.
Write Helper Functions:

Inside the helper file, define your custom helper functions as regular PHP functions. For example:
Copy
<?php

function customHelperFunction() {
    // Your custom code here
}
Autoloading the Helper File:

To make your helper functions available throughout your application, you need to autoload the helper file. Open the composer.json file and add your helper file to the files section:

"autoload": {
    "files": [
        "app/your-helper-file.php"
    ]
}
After making this change, run composer dump-autoload to load the helper file.

Using the Custom Helper:

You can now use your custom helper functions anywhere in your Laravel application. Simply call the function like this:
Copy
customHelperFunction();
For example, you can use it in your controllers, views, or any other part of your Laravel application.

Autoloading Considerations:

If your custom helper is meant to be used in all parts of your application, you can include it in the composer.json file as mentioned earlier. However, if you want to restrict its usage to specific parts of your application, consider using the app/helpers directory and auto-loading only the necessary helper files.
Remember to clear the cache if you face any issues by running composer dump-autoload after making changes to the autoloading configuration. This will ensure that your custom helper functions are loaded properly.
