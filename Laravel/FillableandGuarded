The main difference between fillable and guarded properties on your Laravel model class lies in how they control mass assignment. Mass assignment refers to assigning multiple values to a model's attributes at once, often using an array.

Here's a breakdown of their functionalities:

Fillable:

Acts as a whitelist.
Specifies the attributes that can be mass assigned.
Any attribute not listed in fillable is not mass assignable.
This approach is ideal when you have a limited number of fillable attributes.
Guarded:

Acts as a blacklist.
Specifies the attributes that cannot be mass assigned.
All attributes not listed in guarded are considered mass assignable by default.
This approach is suitable when you have a large number of attributes and want to restrict updates to only a few specific ones.
Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

Property	Functionality	Use Case
fillable	Whitelist - allows mass assignment for specified attributes	Models with limited fillable attributes
guarded	Blacklist - prevents mass assignment for specified attributes	Models with many attributes, restrict updates to specific ones
Important points to remember:

You should use only one of these properties in your model class, not both.
Laravel recommends using fillable for security reasons, as it explicitly defines which attributes can be modified.
You can completely disable mass assignment by setting $guarded = ['*'].
