=> packages for authentication will be Passport
    composer requires laravel/Passport
    It generates a file(composer.json) in your project directory to keep track of all your packages. A default composer.json file of your laravel project will look something like below

    two methods used 
    1) up  php artisan migrate
        public function up(){
            schema::create('user',function(bludeprint $table)
            {
                $table->id();
                $table->string('name');
            });
        }
       
    2) down php artisan migrate:rollback
         public function down(){

        }

=> php artisan migrate:rollback     only rolls back the previously run migration

=> php artisan make:seeder usertableseeder      create a new Seeder
=> php artisan db:seed

=> php artisan make:factory UserFactory --class=User        create a new factor



=> model file 

     /**
     * The attributes that are mass assignable.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = []; // use the access in insert data in databse 
                            Specifies which fields can be mass assigned. For example, you can use the fill() method to mass assign fields.

    $guarded :  Specifies which fields can't be mass assigned. For example, if you use fill() with properties that are guarded, they won't be saved in the database.
    $hidden :   Specifies which fields won't be shown when a model is serialized to JSON or an array. The returned JSON will skip all fields mentioned in hidden.

    });

=> facade :  facade is a class that wraps a non-static function and turns it into a static function. Facades provide a "static" interface to            classes that are available in the application's service container

    -> step 1 : app/facade
    invoice.php
    namespace App/facades;

    class Invoice{
        public functin companyName(){
            return 'ABC PVT LTD..';
        }
    }

    -> step 2 : app/facade

    invoice.php
    namespace App/facades;

    class InvoiceFacade{
        protected static functin getFacadeAccessor(){
            return 'Invoice';
        }
    }

-> step 3 : app/provide/appServiceProvider.php
        use App\Facades\Invoice;
        public function register(){
            $this->bind('Invoice',function($app){
                return new Invoice();
            });
        }
-> step 4 : config/app.php
