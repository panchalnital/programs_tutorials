unit test and functional test 
========================================
Unit testing and feature testing are both methods of software testing in Laravel:

Unit testing:
This is a necessary part of the development process. It focuses on a small piece of code, like a method inside a class. Unit tests are written from a programmer's perspective to ensure a class's method performs specific tasks. Unit testing is fast and helps write clean code, but it doesn't guarantee that the system will work as expected.

Feature testing :
This has a broader view, such as registering a user and validating their details. Feature tests verify if a particular feature is working as designed. Feature tests are written from the user's perspective to ensure that the system is functioning as users expect it to. 

--------------------------------------

Here are some steps for unit testing in Laravel:
    Create new test classes
    Run the artisan command to create a new test class
    Write a basic unit test case 
You can use PHPUnit, a well-known and optimized unit testing package, to perform unit testing for your app. 
    To create a new test case, you can use the make:test Artisan command:
    To create a test in the tests/Feature directory: php artisan make:test UserTest
    To create a test in the tests/Unit directory: php artisan make:test UserTest --unit

PHPUnit is a popular testing framework for PHP, widely used for unit testing. It provides a wide range of assertions to verify the behavior of your code. Here's a list of some commonly used assertions in PHPUnit:

1. **assertEquals($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that two values are equal.

2. **assertNotEquals($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that two values are not equal.

3. **assertTrue($condition, $message = '')**: Asserts that a condition is true.

4. **assertFalse($condition, $message = '')**: Asserts that a condition is false.

5. **assertNull($actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that a value is null.

6. **assertNotNull($actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that a value is not null.

7. **assertSame($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that two values are identical (same type and value).

8. **assertNotSame($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that two values are not identical.

9. **assertGreaterThan($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that a value is greater than another.

10. **assertGreaterThanOrEqual($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that a value is greater than or equal to another.

11. **assertLessThan($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that a value is less than another.

12. **assertLessThanOrEqual($expected, $actual, $message = '')**: Asserts that a value is less than or equal to another.

13. **assertContains($needle, $haystack, $message = '')**: Asserts that a haystack contains a needle.

14. **assertNotContains($needle, $haystack, $message = '')**: Asserts that a haystack does not contain a needle.

15. **assertArrayHasKey($key, $array, $message = '')**: Asserts that an array has a specified key.

16. **assertArrayNotHasKey($key, $array, $message = '')**: Asserts that an array does not have a specified key.

These are just a few of the many assertions available in PHPUnit. They provide a comprehensive toolkit for testing your PHP code effectively.
