    =>compose update command should be used only in development phase of the projects baecuse it updates the dependencies and aslo update the compser.locak file

    =>if you run this command in production it can breack your code.beacuse it'll update the dependencies which is not good in production beacuse version may change

composer.lock
    => composer.install in production 
    => beacuse not update any depencey
    => if require exite version view on compser,lock
    => when you run composer install command in terminal  reads the composer.locak file and install dependencies which are mentioned this file
    => but what if the composer,lock file does not exists
    =>so in thid case it reads the composer,json file and install the dependencies then creates the composerloca

    =>production you need only those dependencies which you have used in deveopment phase,and those  dependencies can be found with thire exact version in composer.lock
