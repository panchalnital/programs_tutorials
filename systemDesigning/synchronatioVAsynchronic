In PHP, synchronous and asynchronous programming refer to different ways of executing code and handling tasks.

1. **Synchronous Programming**:
   - In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, in the order they are defined.
   - When a function or task is called, the program waits for it to complete before moving on to the next task.
   - Synchronous programming is straightforward and easy to understand, as the flow of execution is predictable and linear.
   - However, synchronous programming can lead to blocking behavior, where the program waits for long-running tasks to complete, potentially causing delays and inefficiencies.

2. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - In asynchronous programming, tasks are executed concurrently, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously without waiting for each other to complete.
   - Asynchronous programming is often used for tasks that involve I/O operations, such as reading from files, making HTTP requests, or querying databases, where waiting for the operation to complete would be inefficient.
   - Instead of blocking the program while waiting for I/O operations to finish, asynchronous programming allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
   - Asynchronous programming typically involves using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax to handle asynchronous tasks and manage their results.

**Differences**:

1. **Execution Flow**:
   - In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, in a predictable and linear manner.
   - In asynchronous programming, tasks can be executed concurrently, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously without waiting for each other to complete.

2. **Blocking vs. Non-blocking**:
   - Synchronous programming may lead to blocking behavior, where the program waits for long-running tasks to complete before moving on to the next task.
   - Asynchronous programming is non-blocking, allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for asynchronous operations, such as I/O operations, to complete.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Synchronous programming is straightforward and easy to understand but may be less efficient for tasks involving I/O operations or long-running tasks.
   - Asynchronous programming can improve efficiency and performance by allowing the program to perform other tasks while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.

4. **Concurrency**:
   - Synchronous programming does not inherently support concurrency, as tasks are executed sequentially.
   - Asynchronous programming enables concurrency by allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving the overall responsiveness and throughput of the application.

In summary, synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently, improving efficiency, responsiveness, and performance, especially for tasks involving I/O operations.
