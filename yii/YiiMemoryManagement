Here are some tips for managing memory in Yii:

Enabling the PHP opcode cache: This can improve the performance of any PHP application and significantly lower memory usage.

Avoid fetching too much data from the database: This can exhaust the memory allocated to PHP.
Use a foreach instead of readAll: ReadAll returns all the rows in a single array, which can be a memory problem.
Turn off logging and debug: This can make AR less memory consuming. 

Here are some other things to consider:
PHP memory limit
    The default value is 128MB, but this is often raised depending on the amount of memory needed for the web application.
Memory limit setting
    This fixes a memory size for executing a script. It prevents ineffectively coded scripts on the server that designate superfluous space.
Dynatrace Hub
    This provides comprehensive out-of-the box metrics that can give insights into memory allocation, garbage collection, and thread behavior.
