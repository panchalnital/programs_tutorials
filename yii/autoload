In Yii 2.0, the PSR-4 autoloading is typically configured in the composer.json file. You would find a "autoload" section in the file where you can specify the PSR-4 namespace-to-directory mapping. For example:

composer.json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "app\\": "src/"
        }
    }
}
In this example, it's saying that classes in the app namespace should be autoloaded from the src/ directory
