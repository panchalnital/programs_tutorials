Yii is a PHP framework that supports the use of extensions to enhance its functionality. Here is a list of some popular Yii extensions as of my last knowledge update in January 2022:

1. **Yii2-Debug:** A powerful debugging and profiling toolbar for Yii 2.

2. **Yii2-Bootstrap:** Integrates the Bootstrap CSS framework with Yii 2.

3. **Yii2-Gii:** A web-based code generation tool for Yii 2.

4. **Yii2-Swiftmailer:** Integrates the SwiftMailer library for sending emails.

5. **Yii2-User:** A flexible user management module for Yii 2.

6. **Yii2-Gridview:** An enhanced gridview widget for Yii 2.

7. **Yii2-Redactor:** Integrates the Redactor WYSIWYG editor with Yii 2.

8. **Yii2-Imagine:** Provides a simple wrapper for the Imagine image manipulation library.

9. **Yii2-Excel:** Allows the export of data to Excel and other spreadsheet formats.

10. **Yii2-Authclient:** Enables third-party authentication through OAuth and other protocols.

Please note that the availability and popularity of extensions may change over time, so it's a good idea to check the Yii extensions repository or other community sources for the most up-to-date information. Additionally, make sure the extensions are compatible with the version of Yii you are using.

===================================================
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-redis:"~2.0.0"

Configuration
To use this extension, you have to configure the Connection class in your application configuration:

return [
    //....
    'components' => [
        'redis' => [
            'class' => 'yii\redis\Connection',
            'hostname' => 'localhost',
            'port' => 6379,
            'database' => 0,
        ],
    ]
];

=============
// keep the data in cache for at most 45 seconds
$cache->set($key, $data, 45);


get(): retrieves a data item from cache with a specified key. A false value will be returned if the data item is not found in the cache or is expired/invalidated.
set(): stores a data item identified by a key in cache.
add(): stores a data item identified by a key in cache if the key is not found in the cache.
getOrSet(): retrieves a data item from cache with a specified key or executes passed callback, stores return of the callback in a cache by a key and returns that data.
multiGet(): retrieves multiple data items from cache with the specified keys.
multiSet(): stores multiple data items in cache. Each item is identified by a key.
multiAdd(): stores multiple data items in cache. Each item is identified by a key. If a key already exists in the cache, the data item will be skipped.
exists(): returns a value indicating whether the specified key is found in the cache.
delete(): removes a data item identified by a key from the cache.
flush(): removes all data items from the cache.


// Assuming you're inside a controller or some Yii2 component

// Get the cache component
$cache = Yii::$app->cache;

// Try to retrieve data from cache
$data = $cache->get('exampleKey');

// Check if data is not found in cache
if ($data === false) {
    // Data is not in cache, fetch it from the source (e.g., database, API, etc.)
    $data = /* Your logic to fetch the data */;

    // Save the data in cache for future use
    $cache->set('exampleKey', $data, 3600); // Cache for 1 hour (you can adjust the duration as needed)
}

// Now you can use $data knowing that it might be from cache or freshly fetched
